Some testing ideas:

floating blocks
 start state:
2,0,3,red
-1,0,-1,blue
4,0,-8,green
 goal state:
?,2,?,red
 this will help test the agents ability to plan to move blocks it doesn't know it needs by goal spec

tiny tower
 start state:
-5,0,12,red
-6,0,12,drone
20,0,10,blue
 goal state
?,0,?,red
?,1,?,blue
